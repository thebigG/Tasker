/**
 *@brief The Engine namespace has all of the
 *Hardware Listeners and classes that make up the "Engine" of Tasker
 * When it comes to detecting user interaction with hardware
 * such as KeyboardListener, AudioListener, Timer and any other class that directly
 * aid these entities such as AudioDevice.
 * Listener classes are platform-dependent. Given that they work
 * very close to hardware, you will probably find a lot of macros
 * that test whether the OS is Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.
 *
 * Right now these listeners have been developed mostly with Linux in mind.
 * The only one that is "cross-platform" is the AudioListener, however, I haven't tested it
 * thoroughly on other platforms such MacOS or Windows.
 * I would love(and plan) to have these listeners work well(specially the KeyboardListener)
 * on Windows and MacOS, but that's not going to happen in a while, given that my priority is
 * Linux right now.
 *
 * If you have any ideas/want to make hardware listeners for this app, PR and issues are super welcome!
