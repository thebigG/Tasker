 * Because of this, use this method with GREAT caution
 * and awereness of the fact that even though when this class is innstantiated
 * audioMachine SHOULD be instantiated by qThread, it is NOT a guarantee.
 * When it comes to threads, we are at the mercy of the OS.
 * While it is unlikely,
 * it is very possible that audioMachine might be have a nullptr value.
 * So please, ALWAYS do a null check BEFORE using it.
 *
 * Since audioMachine a unique_prt(AKA "smart pointer"), you
 * don't have to call delete, or do any kind of memory-management
 * nonsense. And please, just don't, if you do the system will crash.
 * It's why we have smart pointers,
 * let them do the hard work.
